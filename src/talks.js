    abstract: `Since AWS launched Lambda in 2014, the term ‚Äúserverless‚Äù has been used (and misused) to describe compute models, technologies, architectural patterns, operational constructs, and even rebranded cgi-bins. The term is now used so broadly that it‚Äôs turning into a buzzword with no discernible meaning.

    In this talk, we‚Äôll cut through all the marketing hype, and discuss why the underlying concept of ‚Äúserverless‚Äù, and the superpowers that come with it, are much more important than the name itself. We‚Äôll cover:
    - A brief history of development and how/why we got to serverless
    - Why serverless requires developers to think differently about how applications are built
    - Serverless use cases that add real business value
    - Problems with serverless and what the industry needs to do better

With just one command ('now' or 'git push') you get a URL back with your working deployment, which takes advantage of a global CDN network that automatically serves your static assets (such as a static frontend) and invokes lambdas on-demand. Deploying is faster. The resulting websites and applications load faster. Failures are minimized or flat-out disappear. No monitoring is required. It all sounds like heaven... except serverless is different. This talk will explore how we are helping developers get all these benefits and migrate from a serverful world without a hassle.
