    abstract: `Need a quick and simple mechanism to collect, analyse and visualise data from your serverless apps, without running servers of course? In this case study, we’ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.`

    speaker: "Simona Cotin",
    abstract: `Current trends in software and backend architecture is evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. The latest development on that front is the advent of serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost-effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint. GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook.`

    In the first part of this workshop, you’ll get hands-on experience building a web application using Firebase products. Firebase provides the entire backend for this app, so won’t won’t need to deal with servers at all.
    In the second part, you’ll add some new features to the app using Cloud Functions for Firebase. You’ll write backend code in JavaScript, again, without the need to maintain or scale backend servers.`,
