    title: "Serverless - more FinDev than DevOps",
    speaker: "Yan Cui",
    abstract: `A lot of the discussions around serverless has been about the benefits it brings to the table with regards to DevOps - more infrastructure automation, scalability and resilience out-of-the-box. Developers love it because they can offload even more undifferentiated heavy-lifting to their cloud vendors, and they can focus their energy on building the things their users want. Businesses benefit hugely too because they have happier developers who can deliver value faster!\nBut the true power of the serverless paradigm, for the business, is the pay-per-invocation model. It allows them to finally understand the cost of user transactions, and calculate the return on investment of features. And if you embrace this superpower then it can even open the door to an entirely new business model built around pay-per-transaction and give your business the competitive advantage over your rivals.`

In this case study, we’ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.`

    abstract: `Current trends in software and backend architecture is evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. The latest development on that front is the advent of serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost-effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint. GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook.`

Your security is only as strong as the weakest human link and their patience and diligence in following proper protocols. Serverless computing is the future of how complex software systems and their security will be designed and built. This talk will demonstrate several migration cases that Serverless technology can already help with today.\nSome modern hosting platforms don’t give you enough access to deploy certain security features. Let’s say you would like to use security headers like Content Security Policy and Strict Transport Security, mange bot traffic, or do some advanced multi-factor authentication; that can be a struggle and consume many resources in your current infrastructure. With futuristic serverless platforms, such solutions can be deployed in seconds.`

But it turns out that the simple runs out very quick. By the time I discovered this I was already hooked on both Conversational AI and Serverless technologies. Conversational Interfaces let users interact with technology in a new way - and Serverless lets developers build software in a new way. Combined they bring something brand new that requires both learning new skills and applying existing skills in new ways.\nOur team has built an Employee Digital Assistant for the employees of our Fortune 100 company. Using practical examples from our chatbot, let me share with you some of the lessons we learned that can get you started with your own chatbot. Building a simple chatbot is simple - building a great chatbot is what I’m going to show you how to do.`
