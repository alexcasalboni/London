In this case study, we’ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.`

    abstract: `With Firebase, you can build truly serverless mobile and web applications!
    In the first part of this workshop, you’ll get hands-on experience building a web application using Firebase products. Firebase provides the entire backend for this app, so won’t won’t need to deal with servers at all.
    In the second part, you’ll add some new features to the app using Cloud Functions for Firebase. You’ll write backend code in JavaScript, again, without the need to maintain or scale backend servers.`,
