    title: "Serverless - more FinDev than DevOps",
    speaker: "Yan Cui",
    abstract: `A lot of the discussions around serverless has been about the benefits it brings to the table with regards to DevOps - more infrastructure automation, scalability and resilience out-of-the-box. Developers love it because they can offload even more undifferentiated heavy-lifting to their cloud vendors, and they can focus their energy on building the things their users want. Businesses benefit hugely too because they have happier developers who can deliver value faster!\nBut the true power of the serverless paradigm, for the business, is the pay-per-invocation model. It allows them to finally understand the cost of user transactions, and calculate the return on investment of features. And if you embrace this superpower then it can even open the door to an entirely new business model built around pay-per-transaction and give your business the competitive advantage over your rivals.`

    speaker: "Ian Massingham",
    abstract: `Need a quick and simple mechanism to collect, analyse and visualise data from your serverless apps, without running servers of course? In this case study, we’ll explore one example of application simplification and cost optimisation by removing Elasticsearch and Kibana from an application architecture, replacing them with a scalable serverless alternative, reducing running costs for the app by more than 90% in the process. Based on AWS services, this talk will feature AWS Lambda, Kinesis, Glue, Athena & QuickSight.`

    title: "Build Scalable APIs using GraphQL and Serverless",
    speaker: "Simona Cotin",
    abstract: `Current trends in software and backend architecture is evolving towards a more loosely coupled more granular design. The latest development on that front is the advent of serverless which allows you to run applications in very cost-effective ephemeral services. This is why it is important to have a proper gateway for your API that is able to route all your requests to the designated endpoint. GraphQL stands out in that respect as being a mature open sourced standard started at Facebook.`
