    <p>We seek to create a diverse and inclusive community for serverless developers. <span class="line-break no-mobile"></span>
      We want to include and encourage people of all races, ethnicities, genders, <span class="line-break no-mobile"></span>
      religions, sexual orientations, abilities, technical experience and ages.
    </p>

    <p>We have committed to provide 25% of all standard tickets to diversity groups <span class="line-break no-mobile"></span>
      to help remove any financial barrier. More details are coming soon.
    </p>

    <p>You can also choose to buy a Diversity Sponsor Ticket and we'll donate it to a <span class="line-break no-mobile"></span>
       Diversity Scholar.
