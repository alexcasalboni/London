      <h1>Ran Ribenzaft</h1>
      <p>I’m a passionate developer, with vast experience in network, infrastructure, and cyber-security. Constantly chasing new technologies - as the current one is Serverless. Love sharing open source tools to make everyone lives easier :) In my current role, I’m the co-founder and CTO at Epsagon - monitoring for serverless applications. I love swimming, traveling around the world, and taking breathtaking pictures.</p>
      <h2>Talk: Distributed Tracing in Serverless Systems</h2>

In serverless, there are unique challenges and opportunities which make distributed tracing powerful for gaining observability.</p>
