      <h2>Talk: Serverless Cheat Sheet for business discussions</h2>
      <p>We talked and worked with lots of companies in the last months and there are 2 types of people: the ones who say “hey, the future is here so let’s do serverless and get rid of the unnecessary stuff. The other ones are “we can only dream of serverless, please fix our containers first and then we can talk with our C[A-Z]O’s about serverless. We are convinced that more understanding of the business side (even though it looks often pretty obvious) is a crucial part. So, let’s work with a cheat sheet to speed things up and enable your organisation.</p>
