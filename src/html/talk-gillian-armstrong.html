      <h1>Gillian Armstrong</h1>
      <p>Gillian works as a Technical Lead in the Emerging Technologies unit in Liberty Mutual. Her team is focused on thinking about big problems, and working out how to solve them using innovative technology in interesting new ways. At the moment she is working on Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on Conversational AI design and development. She has more than a decade’s worth of experience in many technologies across the full stack, and loves being a software engineer as it allows her not just to think up big ideas, but also to make them a reality.</p>
      <h2>Talk: Serverless and Chatbots: A Match Made in the Cloud</h2>
      <p>The Internet tutorials promised that building a chatbot was simple, and that the magic of Serverless would make it even simpler. And it was true. But it turns out that the simple runs out very quick. By the time I discovered this I was already hooked on both Conversational AI and Serverless technologies. Conversational Interfaces let users interact with technology in a new way - and Serverless lets developers build software in a new way. Combined they bring something brand new that requires both learning new skills and applying existing skills in new ways.<br/><br/>Our team has built an Employee Digital Assistant for the employees of our Fortune 100 company. Using practical examples from our chatbot, let me share with you some of the lessons we learned that can get you started with your own chatbot. Building a simple chatbot is simple - building a great chatbot is what I’m going to show you how to do.</p>
